        Retrieve a single project. Projects#show uses pagination by default - we’ll return up to the first 500 medias in a Project. If you have more than 500 medias in a Project, you’ll need to add a query param, page=2 to get the second page of medias (and the third, etc.). You can check how many pages you will need by looking at the media_count in your first request.

        This method does not copy the project’s sharing information (i.e. users that could see the old project will not automatically be able to see the new one).
        For the request you can specify the owner of a new project by passing an optional parameter. The person you specify must be a Manager in the account.
        For the response, the HTTP Location header will be set to the URL where the new project resource resides. The body of the response will contain an object representing the new copy of the project that was just created.

            The cursor value of the last record can be used to fetch records after the current result set and
            the cursor of the first record can be used to fetch records before the result set.

            NOTE: a cursor value is only valid if the `sort_by` value hasn't changed from the
            last fetch. For example, you cannot fetch using `sort_by` id and than pass that
            cursor value to a `sort_by` name.

        Restore archived medias to your account. This method accepts a list of up to 100 medias to restore per request. It processes requests asynchronously and will return a background_job_status object rather than the typical Media response object. Your account must have access to the Archiving feature to use this method.
