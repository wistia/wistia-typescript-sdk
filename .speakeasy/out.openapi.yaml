            pagination will also be turned on if `cursor[before]` or `cursor[after]`
            are set. Records returned will have a `cursor` property set which can be used to fetch more records in the same `sort_by` ordering.
            The cursor value of the last record can be used to fetch records after the current result set and
            the cursor of the first record can be used to fetch records before the result set.

            NOTE: a cursor value is only valid if the `sort_by` value hasn't changed from the
            last fetch. For example, you cannot fetch using `sort_by` id and than pass that
            cursor value to a `sort_by` name.

                  A folder (previously called a project) is a container in which to organize media into. It can be
                  used to set permissions that apply to all the media in the folder as well as
                  organizing media into subfolders (previously called media groups).

      summary: Copy Folder
      description: |
        This copies a folder (previously called project) and all its media and subfolders asynchronously in a background job.

        This method does not copy the folder’s sharing information (i.e. users that could see the old folder will not automatically be able to see the new one).

        For the request you can specify the owner of a new folder by passing an optional parameter. The person you specify must be a Manager in the account.

        The body of the response will contain an object representing the background job that was created.

            pagination will also be turned on if `cursor[before]` or `cursor[after]`
            are set. Records returned will have a `cursor` property set which can be used to fetch more records in the same `sort_by` ordering.
            The cursor value of the last record can be used to fetch records after the current result set and
            the cursor of the first record can be used to fetch records before the result set.

            NOTE: a cursor value is only valid if the `sort_by` value hasn't changed from the
            last fetch. For example, you cannot fetch using `sort_by` id and than pass that
            cursor value to a `sort_by` name.

      summary: Move Media
      description: |
        Move one or many media to a different folder and optionally to a specific subfolder.
        Max 100 media per request, and max 10 requests in 5 minutes.
        Note: this is a different rate limit than applies to the rest of the api!

        If a subfolder_id is provided, media will be moved to that subfolder. The subfolder
        must belong to the specified folder.

        Returns a Background Job as the move is async.

      summary: Bulk Tag Media
      description: |
        This method accepts a list of medias to tag. It processes requests asynchronously and will return a background_job_status object rather than the typical Media response object.

        The tags will be added to the existing tags on each media file, not replaced.

            the cursor of the first record can be used to fetch records before the result set.

            NOTE: a cursor value is only valid if the `sort_by` value hasn't changed from the
            last fetch. For example, you cannot fetch using `sort_by` id and than pass that

            The cursor value of the last record can be used to fetch records after the current result set and
            the cursor of the first record can be used to fetch records before the result set.

            NOTE: a cursor value is only valid if the `sort_by` value hasn't changed from the
            last fetch. For example, you cannot fetch using `sort_by` id and than pass that
            cursor value to a `sort_by` name.

            pagination will also be turned on if `cursor[before]` or `cursor[after]`
            are set. Records returned will have a `cursor` property set which can be used to fetch more records in the same `sort_by` ordering.
            The cursor value of the last record can be used to fetch records after the current result set and
            the cursor of the first record can be used to fetch records before the result set.

            NOTE: a cursor value is only valid if the `sort_by` value hasn't changed from the
            last fetch. For example, you cannot fetch using `sort_by` id and than pass that
            cursor value to a `sort_by` name.

                                A media generally represents a video or an audio which can be embedded into your website.

                                CDN-backed medias are accessible using this url structure: https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/{hashed_id}.m3u8.

            pagination will also be turned on if `cursor[before]` or `cursor[after]`
            are set. Records returned will have a `cursor` property set which can be used to fetch more records in the same `sort_by` ordering.
            The cursor value of the last record can be used to fetch records after the current result set and
            the cursor of the first record can be used to fetch records before the result set.

            NOTE: a cursor value is only valid if the `sort_by` value hasn't changed from the
            last fetch. For example, you cannot fetch using `sort_by` id and than pass that
            cursor value to a `sort_by` name.

        If `cursor[enabled]` is set to 1 than cursor pagination is enabled and the
        first set of records are fetched up to the `per_page`. Cursor
        pagination will also be turned on if `cursor[before]` or `cursor[after]`
        are set. Records returned will have a `cursor` property set which can be used to fetch more records in the same `sort_by` ordering.
        The cursor value of the last record can be used to fetch records after the current result set and
        the cursor of the first record can be used to fetch records before the result set.

        NOTE: a cursor value is only valid if the `sort_by` value hasn't changed from the
        last fetch. For example, you cannot fetch using `sort_by` id and than pass that
        cursor value to a `sort_by` name.
